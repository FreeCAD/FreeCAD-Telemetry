# FreeCAD-Telemetry Privacy Policy

The FreeCAD-Telemetry Addon is an optional Addon for FreeCAD that collects pseudonymized usage information. That
information is transmitted across the internet and stored in a centralized database, indexed by a unique user ID
generated randomly when first launched. While IP address data is used in communication with the server, that data is
discarded as soon as possible, and is not stored with the individual data transmissions.

The raw information is available only to FreeCAD Maintainers and system administrators. Aggregate data is provided to
the public for the purpose of informing developers about how FreeCAD is used so that their efforts may be focused on the
most significant use-cases and problem areas. Users may disable the addon at any time, and request removal of all data
associated with their UUID by sending a request with that UUID to telemetry@freecad.org.

The raw data will never be sold, rented, or otherwise provided to third parties.


## GDPR Compliance

* Data is collected and processed by [The FreeCAD project association AISBL](https://fpa.freecad.org/) (FPA) We may be
contacted about this Addon via email at [telemetry@freecad.org](mailto:telemetry@freecad.org). All data is transmitted
to and processed in the [PostHog](https://posthog.com) data center in Frankfurt and is never stored outside the EU.
* The data is collected to gain knowledge about how people use FreeCAD, and where developer efforts could best be
focused to improve the software experience for the most people.
* The lawful basis on which the data processing is based is Consent. This Addon is not required for the operation of
FreeCAD, and must be installed through user action. Upon installation, when the Addon is first launched the user is
prompted to confirm their interest in participating in the data collection program. They are informed that they may
withdraw their consent then, or at any later time.
* Data collection is optional, and fine-grained control is given to the user to select which data collection they are
willing to participate in. Participating in the data collection provides no direct benefit to the user except through
the continued improvement of the software, and use of FreeCAD is not predicated on participation in the Telemetry
program. There are no consequences for the user for choosing not to participate, or of withdrawing their participation
at a later date.
* The data is collected by [The FreeCAD project association AISBL](https://fpa.freecad.org/) who stewards the data
on behalf of all users and developers of FreeCAD. Only FPA officers, FreeCAD's maintainers, and system administrators
have access to the raw data, but aggregate data will be made available to the public on the FPA's website so that any
interested party may participate in the project.
* Data is retained for 90 days. Retention is managed by [PostHog](https://posthog.com), our telemetry service provider.
You may also request deletion of events related to your UUID at any time (see
[Requesting removal of data](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Telemetry/blob/main/README.md#data-removal)).
* For this Addon, the contact point on personal data protection issues is FPA Chair
[Yorik van Havre](mailto:yorik@freecad.org).
* You have the right to file a complaint with your local Data Protection Agency.
