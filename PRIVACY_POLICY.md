# FreeCAD-Telemetry Privacy Policy

The FreeCAD-Telemetry Addon is an optional Addon for FreeCAD that collects anonymized usage information. That
information is transmitted across the internet and stored in a centralized database. The raw information is
available only to FreeCAD Maintainers and system administrators. Aggregate data is provided to the general public
for the purpose of informing developers about how FreeCAD is used so that their efforts may be focused on the
most significant use-cases and problem areas.
