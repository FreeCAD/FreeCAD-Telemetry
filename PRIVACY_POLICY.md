# FreeCAD-Telemetry Privacy Policy

**NOTE**: This addon is currently in beta testing, so while developers and system administrators are making their
best efforts to be highly conscious of user privacy during this period, this privacy policy itself is a work in
progress. Please make suggestions via a GitHub Issue or directly as a Pull Request on this file.

The FreeCAD-Telemetry Addon is an optional Addon for FreeCAD that collects anonymized usage information. That
information is transmitted across the internet and stored in a centralized database, indexed by a unique user ID
generated randomly when first launched. While IP address data is used in communication with the server, that data is
discarded as soon as possible, and is not stored with the individual data transmissions.

The raw information is available only to FreeCAD Maintainers and system administrators. Aggregate data is provided to
the public for the purpose of informing developers about how FreeCAD is used so that their efforts may be focused on the
most significant use-cases and problem areas. Users may disable the addon at any time, and request removal of all data
associated with their UUID by sending a request with that UUID to telemetry@freecad.org.

The raw data will never be sold, rented, or otherwise provided to third parties. It remains the exclusive property
of The FreeCAD project association AISBL, who will make their best efforts to ensure the security of the data.

This privacy policy was last updated 19 February 2025.
