# Security Policy

The FreeCAD project is a FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) project that has a community of thousands of users and
hundreds of developers worldwide. This Telemetry addon is part of that project: the security policy for this addon
matches that of [FreeCAD itself](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/main/SECURITY.md). We encourage responsible
reporting of security vulnerabilities that may affect users of this software, and will endeavor to address these
vulnerabilities when they are discovered.

This addon can be disabled or removed at any time without impacting the use of FreeCAD itself: once removed or
disabled via its preferences panel, no further information is transmitted until/unless it is manually re-enabled.

## Supported Versions

The FreeCAD-Telemetry addon development team implements security fixes to the current development on the main branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
